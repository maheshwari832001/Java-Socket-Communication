One-way communication: The client sends data to the server.
Two-way communication: The server processes and responds to the client's request.

Features

Establishes a connection between a client and server over a network.
Supports both one-way and two-way data exchange.
Implements basic input/output stream handling.
Demonstrates fundamental networking concepts in Java.
