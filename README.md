# Client-Server Socket Communication for Data Exchange 

**Description**

This project demonstrates client-server communication using Java sockets. It includes:<br>
One-way communication: The client sends data to the server.<br>
Two-way communication: The server processes and responds to the client's request.<br>


**Features**

Establishes a connection between a client and server over a network.<br>
Supports both one-way and two-way data exchange.<br>
Implements basic input/output stream handling.<br>
Demonstrates fundamental networking concepts in Java.<br>

##Code Overview

**Server (ServerSoc.java)**

Listens on a specific port (9999).<br>
Accepts client connections.<br>
Reads data from the client.<br>
Sends a response back.<br>

**Client (Client.java)**

Connects to the server on localhost.<br>
Sends a message.<br>
Receives and displays the server's response.<br>


**Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Java. <br>
Networking: Java Sockets (TCP/IP) <br>
